- Please make sure the name you use on your application matches the government-issued photo ID you’ll be presenting when you check in to the event.
- Registration for this event includes access to all sessions, product demos, admission to the Social Hour, and attendance at the keynotes. We also provide complimentary breakfast, lunch, and snacks. In addition, attendees receive an event badge and may be offered additional gifts. If you aren’t sure whether the professional guidelines for your school, university, organization, or agency allows you to accept these items, please check with your local ethics officer before the event.
