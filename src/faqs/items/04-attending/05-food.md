Attendees are offered complimentary breakfast, lunch and snacks during both days of the conference. Food and drinks will also be available on Day 1 during the Social Hour.
All meals will be served in YBCA East Garden and B Restaurant on both days. If you have any special dietary requirements or allergies, please let us know before **10 October** by choosing options upon <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2019/registrations/my-rsvp/confirm-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration</a>.

**Food Allergy Note**: All food is produced in a commercial commissary kitchen that processes eggs, dairy, tree nuts and other allergens. We take allergies very seriously and trace amounts of these ingredients may occur. Those with food allergies should provide their own meals.
