The web is an ecosystem with diversity galore: web standards, multiple browsers, a huge number and variety of devices, and a plethora of tools and services available. This diversity is why the web continues to evolve and we want developers to succeed through each phase of the web's evolution. During the keynote, we'll celebrate every aspect of this diversity - the technologies, the tools and the people, and talk about how we're working together to elevate the web.
